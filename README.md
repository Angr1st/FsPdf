FsPdf
=====
_Builds PDF's from pure F# (and needs a more interesting name)_

Generates PDF content to enable developers to build PDF's programatically.  PDF's are helpful for offline documentation, 
printing, certificates of achievement, TPS reports, customer invoices, taxes, or being an actuary.

### What works?

* Makes a PDF without any extra dependencies (beyond a .NET Standard 2.0 runtime).
* Simple page layout formatting.
* Paths and shapes.

### What's in progress

* Text - you can do it now, but you'll have to read the PDF spec to build the streams of commands.
* Font embedding

### Then what?

* Images
* A higher level DSL so you're not working with PDF primitives.

### Example
Here is an example of a [PDF](https://gist.github.com/ninjarobot/550331efbe260f18a2a64352213af12b) generated by [this test](https://github.com/ninjarobot/FsPdf/blob/171a8d665f7b5a4cf1f80e6f2291d8e05a7b8a2b/tests/FsPdf.Tests/Tests.fs#L49).
